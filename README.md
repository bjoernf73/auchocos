# auchocos

This repository contains (or will contain) a collection of Chocolatey package repositories that are automatically updated. 

The folder `./functions/borrowed` contains scripts with functions borrowed from the repository [flcdrg/au-packages](https://github.com/flcdrg/au-packages). They have a separate LICENSE in that folder which is the identical to the original license in the source repository. 

My implementation is very different, and as of writing this, the borrowed scripts aren't used. They may be in the future.
